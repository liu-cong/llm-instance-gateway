              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                description: |-
                  Selector uses a map of label to watch model server pods
                  that should be included in the InferencePool. ModelServers should not
                  be with any other Service or InferencePool, that behavior is not supported
                  and will result in sub-optimal utilization.
                  In some cases, implementations may translate this to a Service selector, so this matches the simple
                  map used for Service selectors instead of the full Kubernetes LabelSelector type.
